# **News Detection System**

I have used [Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for designing this project of **News Detection System** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

For training models I considered 4 models -
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
